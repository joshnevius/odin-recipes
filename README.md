# odin-recipes

This is a new web project I've created to list recipes. 

As you navigate to the recipe/ folder, you will find three different HTML pages - chicken_zucchini_casserole.html, lasagna.html, and pizza.html. 

Images were pulled from the images/ folder, and linked to each recipe were added in the index.html main page.
